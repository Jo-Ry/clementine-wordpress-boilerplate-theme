/*
	This code generates a set of media queries based on the defined breakpoints in a Sass map called $breakpoints.
	It uses a nested loop to iterate through each breakpoint and its corresponding value.

	For each breakpoint, it checks if it is the first or last breakpoint in the map. If it is, it defines two media queries:
	  * one for screens with a maximum width of the breakpoint value.
	  * one for screens with a minimum width of the breakpoint value.

	  These media queries are stored in a Sass map called $media-queries with keys
	  of the form $breakpoint-down and $breakpoint-up.

	If the current breakpoint is not the first or last breakpoint, it calculates the range of values
	between the previous breakpoint and the current breakpoint. It then defines three media queries:
	  * one for screens with a maximum width of the previous breakpoint value and a minimum width of the current breakpoint value,
	  * one for screens with a minimum width of the current breakpoint value and a maximum width of the next breakpoint value
	  * and one for screens with a minimum width of the current breakpoint value and a maximum width of the current breakpoint value.

	  These media queries are then stored in the same $media-queries map with keys of the form
	  $breakpoint-only, $breakpoint-down, and $breakpoint-up.

	The resulting $media-queries map contains a set of breakpoints that contain variations of single key
	but also have single query where the variations dont apply.
*/

/*
	This map can handle two scenarios:

	* Scenario one is that you need a new break point dependent on the browser width
	  then write the value as a number and please keep it hierarcichal :)

	* Scenario two is that you need a new break point that dont need variations or
	  takes in i number for that matter then write the value as you query instead.
